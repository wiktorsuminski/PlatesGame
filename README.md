# PlatesGame
In Poland, we have specific system for registration plates.<br/>
For example:<br/>
EZG - means (E) Lodzkie (ZG) Zgierz county<br/>
EL - Means (E) Lodzkie (L) Lodz city

It is a pattern where 3 letters almost everytime means county and 2 means city.
Also, first letter always says in which voivodeship vechicle is registered, rest of them means exact region.

I have always wondered where the specific plates come from, so I decided to built a game which will help me to memorize them!

Still in production
